    <h2>Welcome to Signature Bites</h2>
    <p>
        It all began one night when a group of friends laughed over a badly burnt pizza and jokingly said they should open their own restaurant, but what started as humor slowly turned into a serious dream as they realized they shared a passion for food, connection, and creating a welcoming space for people; though none of them were professional chefs or wealthy investors, they combined their different skills, faced financial struggles, paperwork, long nights of renovations, failed recipes, and moments of doubt, yet their belief in the vision kept them moving forward until the day they finally unlocked the doors of their small restaurant, nervously waiting for customers, only to watch the tables gradually fill with laughter and compliments, and in that moment they understood that their journey from a simple joke to a successful opening had not only built a business but strengthened their teamwork, resilience, and faith in turning dreams into reality.

            <h2>How we met</h2>
    <p>We didn’t meet with a grand plan or a shared dream of building something big; we met in ordinary moments that slowly became meaningful—some of us were introduced through work, others through mutual friends, and a few simply crossed paths during casual conversations that somehow lasted for hours, and what started as small talk turned into shared ideas, shared struggles, and shared laughter, until we realized that we weren’t just a random group of individuals but people who challenged, supported, and understood one another; our different personalities and strengths blended naturally—some of us thinkers, some doers, some creatives, some problem-solvers—and over time those late meetings, spontaneous discussions, and countless cups of coffee built trust and friendship, and before we even noticed it, we had become more than colleagues or acquaintances, we had become a team connected not just by circumstance but by belief in each other and in the possibilities we could create together.
